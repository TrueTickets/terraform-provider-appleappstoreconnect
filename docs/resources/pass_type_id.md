# appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id (Resource)

Manages a Pass Type ID in App Store Connect.

Pass Type IDs are required for creating Apple Wallet passes. Each Pass
Type ID represents a specific type of pass (e.g., membership cards,
event tickets, coupons) and must follow Apple's reverse-DNS format.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```hcl
resource "appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id" "example" {
  identifier  = "pass.com.example.membership"
  description = "Membership Pass"
}

output "pass_type_id" {
  value = appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id.example.id
}
```

### Multiple Pass Types

```hcl
resource "appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id" "membership" {
  identifier  = "pass.com.example.membership"
  description = "Membership Cards"
}

resource "appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id" "loyalty" {
  identifier  = "pass.com.example.loyalty"
  description = "Loyalty Program Cards"
}

resource "appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id" "event_ticket" {
  identifier  = "pass.com.example.eventticket"
  description = "Event Tickets"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A description of the Pass Type ID.
- `identifier` (String) The identifier for the Pass Type ID (e.g.,
  'pass.com.example.membership'). This must be unique and follow
  reverse-DNS format.

### Read-Only

- `created_date` (String) The date when the Pass Type ID was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the Pass Type ID.

## Import

Pass Type IDs can be imported using their ID:

```bash
terraform import appleappstoreconnect_pass_type_id.example XXXXXXXXXX
```

Where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the Pass Type ID from App Store Connect (not the
identifier like `pass.com.example`).
